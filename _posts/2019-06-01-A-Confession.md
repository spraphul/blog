My life has always been messy, full of pressure, expectations, disapppointments etc. I was dealing with them(got accustomed). Then you came, awkwardly through a tinder match. I was not expecting a reply as you literally seemed out of reach. I tried, you replied and we talked. You also seemed to be a mess, an exquisite artist, an overflowing jar of talent with her own life policies. I liked it, wanted to know more about you. We talked the entire night, you were innocent telling every piece of your story with utter cuteness, I kept listening. I wanted to hear you bad, you whispered slightly over that phone call and that was the moment I fell for you. You also seemed interested as you told you care and it will increase eventually. You kept sending your arts, I kept being amazed. Slowly I started having the courage to express myself too. The only special thing I could do at that time was to sing for you. The recordings were raw, with no filter, no music and you liked them. You liked the calmness in the voice. The like started getting converted into love. I expressed it many a times but jokingly. I was living my dream. 

But..

For the past few days, I see things changing and myself getting restless. You started ignoring me completely. Whenever I asked if you do, you said no. But deep inside me I can feel everything. I keep staring at our chats, and still have a ray of hope of getting a response for you. Yes, I love you but I don't know the best way to express it. I just say it, plain and simple and I know it's stupid, it's dumb. I don't find any medium to talk to you. I tried texting, calling, messaging but you just don't reply. The only medium now for me seems to be the stories we share on insta, whatsapp etc. I feel you too are in love with someone(probably not me). You may not like me, you may not love me, but don't go like this. If it needs to be an end, I want it to be beautiful. Talk to me, I am not a creep. As I said, I love listening, I will listen to you endlessly. Just talk to me. 

If..

I don't know how are you going to react after reading this. You may block me or ignore me further or there is a slight chance that you will understand too. And for that marginal probability, I am ready to take this risk. 



-------------------------- 2 ---------------------------

I am exhausted. I feel like I am mere a haystick in the crowd of requests you get. I try to be special in some sense but can't get any attention. Forget about being at the bottom, I feel I am not even in the priority list. You told me not to assume something and talk about anything I feel. How can I talk if you won't even respond? You seem to be too modest to tell me to get away. That shows how humble you are. But I don't want to be like others who keep flirting just to get a single reply. I know it's normal for you as you are full of options but think of me as a very "sidha sada ladka" who does not take "feeling" as some playable entity. I asked you to make the ending beautiful if it means to be an end. But not like this. The definition of beautiful is that you tell me directly to my face that I am not good enough to be considered by you. It really pains to be in a dilemma(equivalent to a physical pain). I am someone who opts facing certain failures than uncertain successes which come in bits and pieces. 


Yes, I am not perfect in the sense you dream someone to be. Not even close, perhaps. I may not have the qualities, but I do have the perseverance. But that may not be something you admire. I just wish that when you read this, enlighten me with some clarity on how you think. I found you very difficult to read recently, although it was very simple for me at the start. If I am merely a sheep in the crowd, please don't slaughter me ðŸ¥º(your fav). Just ask me to go away. I assure, I won't be bothering you. Even after I am gone, I won't feel bad as you truly wanted me to go and you said it(the honesty which I like the most).


If I am shown the door outside your heart, this will be the last section of the confession series. If the door can not be opened, more sections will be added further ðŸ˜ƒ(your not so fav).





Your's truly,
An Unknown
