A Confession
---

My life has always been messy, full of pressure, expectations, disapppointments etc. I was dealing with them(got accustomed). Then you came, awkwardly through a tinder match. I was not expecting a reply as you literally seemed out of reach. I tried, you replied and we talked. You also seemed to be a mess, an exquisite artist, an overflowing jar of talent with her own life policies. I liked it, wanted to know more about you. We talked the entire night, you were innocent telling every piece of your story with utter cuteness, I kept listening. I wanted to hear you bad, you whispered slightly over that phone call and that was the moment I fell for you. You also seemed interested as you told you care and it will increase eventually. You kept sending your arts, I kept being amazed. Slowly I started having the courage to express myself too. The only special thing I could do at that time was to sing for you. The recordings were raw, with no filter, no music and you liked them. You liked the calmness in the voice. The like started getting converted into love. I expressed it many a times but jokingly. I was living my dream. 

But..

For the past few days, I see things changing and myself getting restless. You started ignoring me completely. Whenever I asked if you do, you said no. But deep inside me I can feel everything. I keep staring at our chats, and still have a ray of hope of getting a response for you. Yes, I love you but I don't know the best way to express it. I just say it, plain and simple and I know it's stupid, it's dumb. I don't find any medium to talk to you. I tried texting, calling, messaging but you just don't reply. The only medium now for me seems to be the stories we share on insta, whatsapp etc. I feel you too are in love with someone(probably not me). You may not like me, you may not love me, but don't go like this. If it needs to be an end, I want it to be beautiful. Talk to me, I am not a creep. As I said, I love listening, I will listen to you endlessly. Just talk to me. 

If..

I don't know how are you going to react after reading this. You may block me or ignore me further or there is a slight chance that you will understand too. And for that marginal probability, I am ready to take this risk. 


Your's truly,
An Unknown
