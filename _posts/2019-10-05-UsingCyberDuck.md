title : Using CyberDuck ðŸ¦†
---

Many often, we come across scenarios when we need to work on a remote system. Dealing with files through command lines is sometimes a pain for some especially in MacBooks. I recently came to know about a software which provides a better if not the best solution for the problem. 

**CYBERDUCK**

This software comes up with a lot of options like **sftp, HTTP, ftp protocols** and even have the options of dealing with **cloud storages like google cloud, AWS, Azure etc.**


CyberDuck can be downloaded from this [link](https://cyberduck.io/download/).

Its pretty easy to use. ALl you need to do is simply install the software and open it.

You must be seeing a pop up like the one given below:

Click the **Open Connection** tab:

**Select one of the options sftp, stp or anything else.**

Fill in the credentials and its done.
You are ready with a brand new file manager which can be handled as easy as it can get.

The other options you can have here is to download and upload files in a single click.

There are still some points which I feel, make the Linux file manager better than this as you can directly open a readable file in the Linux file manager and here you need to download it first on your local machine. Otherwise, for MacBooks, I found it great to use.

**Keep Learning, Keep Sharing ðŸ˜Š**
