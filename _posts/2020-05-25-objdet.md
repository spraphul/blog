title : Some Key Concepts for Object Detection

It has almost been a month since the self-isolation started. It is quite common to see masks on the faces 
of people while you go out. I also read about some startups building face detectors for masked images. Well,
that forced me go back to my college time and brush up the concepts required for object detection. Hence coming 
to the agenda of the new blog, I am going to cover some concepts which one need to understand before building a 
face-detection algorithm.
