title: Self Worth
---

This blog will not follow the usual trend of discussions on machine learning algorithms or some research paper. This is a compilation of the thoughts which are going
through my head while I sit beside my work desk at the 1 AM in the night after attending the usual meetings. It is about the time when I close my eyes and evaluate 
my entire day and feel like I am the same person standing at the same point where I started yesterday. I feel like, the day was not better, not worse than yesterday. 
It is exactly the same. My worth is literally the same. Okay let's start with the basics as we do in all of our blogs:


I belong to a crowd where the folks expect too much from themselves. They believe that they can achieve anything if they pour in their heart and the hard work. I used to be like that but nowadays my destination seems too far. Its like a cloud of worthlessness has occupied the space between myself and the point I want to reach. The day I started my professional life, I thought working hard with immense dedication to my work will slowly take me to the point I want to reach one day. I was not concerned about the rewards as it seemed like an obvious result when you are honest and determined. But nowadays the spark in the eyes has dimmed.
