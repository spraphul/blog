title: Self Worth
---

This blog will not follow the usual trend of discussions on machine learning algorithms or some research paper. This is a compilation of the thoughts which are going
through my head while I sit beside my work desk at the 1 AM in the night after attending the usual meetings. It is about the time when I close my eyes and evaluate 
my entire day and feel like I am the same person standing at the same point where I started yesterday. I feel like, the day was not better, not worse than yesterday. 
It is exactly the same. My worth is literally the same. Okay let's start with the basics as we do in all of our blogs:


I belong to a crowd where the folks expect too much from themselves. They believe that they can achieve anything if they pour in their heart and the hard work. I used to be like that but nowadays my destination seems too far. Its like a cloud of worthlessness has occupied the space between myself and the point I want to reach. The day I started my professional life, I thought working hard with immense dedication to my work will slowly take me to the point I want to reach one day. I was not concerned about the rewards as it seemed like an obvious result when you are honest and determined. But nowadays the spark in the eyes has dimmed. 

I dreamt of standing out from the crowd achieving something unique. But then I realised, everyone in the surrounding has the same value, no matter how far you stand from them in quality. It does not matter whether you are taking the ownership of the work, the only thing that exists is that I am in the herd where only the 8 hrs spent has the worth and that too is fixed. You don't get rewarded, you don't get praised, you don't get recognition. I have started doubting my self worth now. 


Its like, I am not satisfied with my current state and I can not do anything about it. I have to be like this. I am expected to spent those 8 hours. I have to attend those daily meetings. I have to do the same boring work everyday and I can't even complain. Because no one will listen and those who listen can not do anything about that like me. 

I feel like getting into this state is not my success. Instead, its my biggest failure. The world where I lie currently is too self-centered, too selfish, where you don't get praised for what you have done. You are lured with bits and pieces and you sell yourself for literally nothing. I have been trying to figure out the path to get out of this trap lately and yeah that's me(worthy but the same time, worthless). The two images below itself summarise the story:
