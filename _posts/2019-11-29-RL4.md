title : Reinforcement Learning &#58; Actor-Critic Networks
---

In the previous blog, we dived into the basic implementation of a deep Q-Learning Neural Network. It was a Policy-based duel- network which was used to learn the thief-police-gold game. Now, I have all of a sudden introduced two terms here, **Policy-Based, Duel-Network**. Policy-based methods are those which predict probability of the action to take next being in a given state. As, it could be seen that we were using a softmax layer of output-size=**number of possible actions**, it was nothing but the policy-learning mechanism for the network to learn which action to take further depending on the probabilities.
