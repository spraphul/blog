title : Page Rank Algorithm
---

I generally love reading famous algorithms and the work done by others as they set the platform for the new ideas. I was recently reading about the page rank algorithm which is the base for the creation of a huge giant like Google. Though it is a very old work and most of the junta is already aware of it, I would still like to go through it once again as it certainly gives a good feeling ðŸ˜Š.

### What is Page Rank Algorithm?
It is a link analysis algorithm which ranks the various pages on the web according to their importance. It was invented by two stanford students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998. It is defined in a manner such that a page gets importance whenever an important page links to it. So, imagine the web as a network of nodes connected with each other, where the nodes are the pages and the edges are the links. The value of a node is propagated to its outlink by a mathematical formula. Let us discuss the algorithms step by step:

#### Initial Rank
Let us say the graph consists of **N** nodes. The graph can have multiple disconnected components too but we will discuss more about that later. Initial rank for each of the node will be **1/N**.

#### Rank Updation
Rank of each of the page is updated by the following rule:
