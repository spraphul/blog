### <font color='blue'>Introduction</font>
We always have a desire for the things to happen in the mannner we want them to be -- be it rational or irrational, ethical or non ethical. Ever wondered about the hidden force or energy which helps you make those decisions? We tend to introspect the decisions taken in the past and derive the factors consciously which forced us to take them. What if the decisions were wrong? Is there a way we can avoid making wrong calls? Let us dig a bit deeper which can help us figure out the factors which help us make subconscious decisions.

According to Sigmund Freud -- a well known Psychologist, human behaviours are based on three major pillars which can be visualised as in the picture given above.
The one which is visible clearly above the sea is called our subconscious. This part of mind is what we actually have the control over. With its help, we knowigly make decisions whether they are good or bad. We actually know the factors or the attributes while using our consciousness. Our consciousness is the smartest amongst the three. It can categorize things very easily, the feelings -- good/bad, strong/weak, colours., etc. It is what we learn from our surroundings. 

Then comes the preconscious or the subconscious part of the mind. This part of mind is the most innocent one. It does not know how to differentiate. It is what sits beneath the consciousness and gets triggered within us unknowingly. The most confusing argument in this case can be -- Is subconsciousness the same as human memory? The answer is NO. Memories can be brought into our consciousness advertently whenever we want -- which is not the case with subconsciousness. Subconsciousness is like an assistant to our conscious mind which becomes the decision maker when our conscious is engaged in something else. It does not know whether the act it is forcing us to do is even good or bad. 

The third and most dangerous part of the mind is our unconsciousness. It is the most cunning part of us which mostly is inaccessible. But, sometimes they slip out in the form of dreams or in reality unknowingly. We often tend to ignore them considering them as mistakes. Unconsciousness mostly consists of our repressed thoughts or feelings. They mostly trigger the thoughts which are negative in the rational world. For example, consider being attracted sexually towards your sister, which your conscious mind can never allow you to but can come to your mind unconsciously in your dreams which you have no control over. Since it develops an alternate reality which is unacceptable in your consciousness, we generally play safe and tend to ignore it whenever it gets triggered.
