title : A worthy Tycoon
---

Business by its definition can be said as a group of activities which ensures the
movement of goods, money or services across the market by the term called
trade. We generally judge a successful business by the amount of money it
circulates or the impact it makes in the market. Since there is not abundance of
such names who have created a special mark in the history of market by
creating giant businesses or companies, I am going to talk about a person whose
vision was not only to make a hammering impact on the world in terms of
money but with a vision to make an impact on the human civilization and that
person can be none other than the famous Elon Musk.

Elon musk, a prodigy in itself born in a rich family in South Africa had a
passion for innovation from his childhood. He was a nerd literally digging into
the books all the time. He was such a boring person that none of the children,
not even his siblings wanted to play with him. He had a passion for game
development and started developing small games from the very tender age when
most of us were wondering whether the earth is flat or circular. Question time.
Does being a nerd only makes him worthy of being talked around the world?
Absolutely No. The quality which makes him the most talkable, most loved or
most hated or most fascinating businessman in the world is his ardent desire to
colonize MARS. Again, it sounds funny for most of us but let us dig a bit
deeper into his life. His parents got divorced and two years after living with his
mother, he moved towards his father’s home as he had everything there he
thought his mother could not. He later did not go well with his father and
isolated himself from him. His father wanted him to study in South Africa but
he insisted shifting to Canada and applied for a visa as his mother was a
Canadian originally.

So, he broke up with his family and moved to Canada. He had to live miserably
doing works in farms and mills for a year as he failed to meet his uncle living
there. He took admission in University of Pennsylvania for his bachelors where
he received his dual degree in economics and physics. He then decided to
pursue a PHD from the famous Stanford University but soon dropped out. He
then decided to form his own company with his brother instead of digging into a
life like most of the bachelors.

The company was called Zip2 with a vision to
create a direct communication between the advertisers and the users for the
advertisements given in a newspaper. The website used to run for the day and
he used to code and build it alone during the night. The company struggled a bit
in the beginning but eventually started making a grip and managed to get a deal
with New York Times and Chicago Tribune. When he started hiring coders,
they pointed out the bugs in his unstructured programs and suggested for the
changes which Elon did not like but this was the moment he stepped his foot into becoming a great leader. Zip2 got acquired later for 300 million dollars and
Elon wanted to be the CEO but being a technical guy, the directors did not have
much trust in him and he was shown a way out with some 22 million dollars in
hand. But instead of living a lavish retirement plan, he pushed his entire money
into his other imagination called X.com which aimed at revolutionizing the
banking system that time. But at this time, he was not alone with this motive
and faced a tough competition with the rising rivals Paypal. Elon did an
excellent job to stay into the competition but also made some decisions which
the board members were not in favor of.

Eventually a merger between those two companies was organized and Elon
wanted to continue the role of CEO but the board did not go well with him as he
wanted to shift the UNIX based infrastructure of Paypal to a Microsoft based
infrastructure and pushed him out of the company which again gave him a lofty
amount of dollars which is approximately 132million dollars. He later
purchased the domain name X.com from Paypal as he has an attachment with
the X letter which you can see in most of the places of his life. Being thrown
out of a company you founded one day would have been a huge embarrassment
for someone and so was it for Elon but very few bounce back from it like Steve
Jobs and Elon also belonged to that group. He had this immense mentality of
giving something back to the society through technologies and innovation. He
slowly started getting interested into rockets. At that time, rockets were
expensive stuffs to have for the US government and they used to take aid from
the Russians for their research and findings. Elon had this idea of starting a
private rocket company for their cheaper availability in the country. He started
studying material science and the technologies behind the rocket manufacturing
process. He had the courage to talk with NASA scientists and Russians for his
business. Slowing he kicked into the process and founded another company
called SpaceX. He also gave the initial idea of SolarCity which his cousins
founded later on and later it became the second largest solar power provider in
USA which musk later acquired and worked on numerous projects on it for
aiming an ecosystem for renewable energy sources.

Elon invested his major part of the money into the business which he could
have spent in buying a luxurious villa and a royal lifestyle. He was also deeply
invested into renewable energy resources and declared the CEO of a car
company called Tesla Motors. His desire to learn was out of this world thing.
He is a person heavily looking into the prospects of what artificial intelligence
and machine learning could bring into the society and thus played a major role
in founding an organization called Open-AI focused mainly on AI research.

He interests in AI and human computer interaction let him to found a company
called Neuralink focused on developing research based on the interaction
between machines and humans focusing on nanotechnologies. His another
milestone is forming a company called the boring company which aims to build
tunnels for fast transportation and travel across the world. He also worked
actively in the concepts of hyperloops for speedy travel using pressurized
capsules.

Enough about his personal life. Now let us talk on the impact he made through
the steps he took. Paypal, a name probably you all must know has become a big
thing in transferring money worldwide. SpaceX recently became successful in
testing a bunch of rockets and even NASA adopted one of theirs in their latest
successful mission. Tesla, a company which was in loss for a long period of
time became a company to boast fully autonomous electric cars and if you look
at the company’s stock and compare it with the value it had a decade ago, it will
blow your mind. Elon musk, a name feared to be bankrupt one day recently
became the richest person in the world taking over the powerful Bezoz. The
works which he did may not have created a huge cash flow into the market but
surely has a vision and risky attitude which is almost impossible for a lot of
persons to have. This man is so heavily invested in technologies and the letter X
that he even named his son X AE A-XII which you can easily pronounce.


Now let us talk about some numbers. SpaceX has an approximate revenue of
2billion USD. Tesla has a total revenue of 32billion USD. Musk’s personal
worth is about 182billion USD. If you look at the numbers, you will be amazed
that Musk not only creates businesses but he himself is a business, A tycoon
worthy enough to be talked for ages.
