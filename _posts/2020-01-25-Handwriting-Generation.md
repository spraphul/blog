title : Generating Handwritten Sequences Using LSTMs and Mixed Density Networks
---

As everyone comes up with a resolution at the start of the year, I would be trying to be more infrequent in my blog postingsðŸ˜€. As it has been over a month, I thought of spilling some words here ðŸ˜€. In this blog, we will be discussing about an interesting paper on handwriting synthesis proposed by Alex Graves(DeepMind). I will also be implementing the paper using Tensorflow and Keras. 

#### Problem Definition 
The dataset here is in the form of mathematical representation of handwritten strokes.
