title : Fun with Machine Learning &#58; Building a Sudoku Solver
---

Knowledge of machine learning is not only a geek thing. It can be fun too if you are taking some simple, yet 
interesting problems like solving a Sudoku puzzle.

So, in this post, we will be implementing a **CNN based deep learning network** for solving a sudoku puzzle. We will be using
a dataset, which I found on Kaggle. 

We will start with some definitions:

**1. The dataset consists of one million solved sudoku puzzles.**

**2. The format of the dataset is like this:**

X = [a string of 81 characters] with 0 character meaning, empty block

Y = [a string of 81 characters] with all characters being non-zero and between 1 to 9.
                    

So, we need to convert this into a **9x9** 2-D matrix format first.

After doing that, we will normalize the dataset and then feed it to our model.


**Let's perform the coding part now:**

The code below shows the following pipeline:

**1. necessary imports <br/>
2. data processing <br/>
3. defining the model and compiling it <br/>
4. training the model.**

I hope you enjoyed the blog and the fun part of machine learning.
