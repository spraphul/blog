title : The Days of Struggle
---

The story begins when I finished high school. So before that, I was living with my parents in a town called Nichlaul.
My father was an employee in a sugar factory earning barely 11k a month. Since it was a small town, we were not exposed to 
the urban lifestyle. We were happy, simple living souls in a quarter which consisted of a spacious bedroom, a storeroom, 
a kitchen and an attached washroom. That 150 square feet area was our world. My friend circle used to be a group of four 
consisting me, my elder brother, Akhilesh and Sujeet. Our routine was plain and simple. We woke up early in the morning at 5,
studied in the balcony for an hour or so, went school and then the relieving 3 hours of cricket. Till now, I was a brighter 
student for my parents achieving the first rank in every exam of the class which consisted of 30-40 students I guess. I was 
promised a bicycle in every exam but buying a ranger worth 4k was a big deal for my family. Finally, I got one 
after I scored 0.4 per cent less than 100 in 7th standard.

Yeah, exactly the one I got. We used it for many purposes like sabji lana, chakki se aata lana, coaching jana doctor k paas 
jana and it was all fun.

Okay so coming to life again, I don't remember the time exactly when mobile phones came into the picture. But I do remember 
our first mobile phone, it was a **Nokia 1100.**

and we used it to our full satisfaction but alas, the internet also came into our lives by then. Now we were not in a 
situation to buy an expensive Nokia phone but thanks to God, these Chinese companies
became our friends. We bought one with a huge display above the keyboard, had also a pen in it, obviously supported internet 
and had loud noise which saved our money by preventing us from buying an alarm clock. I won't put a picture of it here üòÖ.

I remember the time when I saw my new maths teacher(Ambreesh Sir) in the sixth standard. I was drawn by his knowledge and
teaching methods. I went up to him and asked him if he takes any coaching classes. He said yes but only to UP board students. 
So to no surprise, I was his first CBSE board student. I was bored with the addition and subtraction that was taught in the 
class so I asked him to teach me the maths of higher classes. So my classes went on and soon after a year I almost perfected 
the mathematics till the tenth standard. I seriously felt like an alone bird in my class and enjoyed solving my brother's book 
who was a class senior to me. As a result, I jumped directly into class 9 to join my brother in a different school which 
seemingly put pressure on my family's expenditure. Though I did not make them sad(except my brother who was the topper then) 
by my performances, it surely became tough for my father to manage. I was made the captain of the school's cricket team. We 
conquered the entire town by defeating almost every school there and that was my only satisfying achievement till then. 

So, after high school, we clearly had no idea what to do next. Inspired by a senior, I simply said, ''IIT karna hai'', but did
not know how it will be a pain in the ass. My father was ready to give everything he had to make his child's dream come true.
We planned for a visit to Delhi for the coachings and all.
We boarded the train from Gorakhpur in the general compartment since we still considered reserved seats as means of luxury. 
We reached Delhi, went to Narayana Academy which promised good ranks in IIT-JEE to the junta. We inquired about the expenses 
and got to know that we will have to pay about around 2 lakhs rupees per year even if I manage to live a minimum standard life
there. Now for a child like me which had not even got the fortune to see 20k rupees altogether, the deal seemed impossible. 
The director quickly read the poverty on my face and came up with an alternate solution. The image below surely depicts what 
would have been my expression.

He told us that if I attend the medical classes, I can learn physics and chemistry there and somehow manage maths myself 
clearing the doubts with the teachers, the fees would get reduced to 1 lakh a year. Thanks to him for his courtesy but even
this sum seemed impossible to me. Although my father was ready(I did not know if he had any hidden treasure), I strongly denied. 


We returned, had no idea where to go from there. I then called a friend Alok Mishra and asked him about his plans. 
He told me about Kanpur and the coaching institutes there. I planned to try my luck once again. My mother borrowed 50k rupees 
from mausi ji(maternal aunt) and hoped that I could make the deal happen this time. I left for Kanpur alone this time, stayed 
at Alok's room for 2 days and knowing that the deal is possible, took admission there. I called my father and told him about 
this. Then, I rented a room for 3000 rupees which was on the 3rd floor, hot like a desert in the month of May. My father and 
elder brother arrived the next day. My father returned the next day and we had still one more task to do(take admission in 
school). Forgot to tell you one thing, my family could afford the coaching fees for only one from the two of us. My brother 
sacrificed his share for me. We took admission in a missionary school and the fees were around 40k rupees for each of us 
summing it to 80k rupees a year which needed to be paid in 3 instalments. 

So, the journey began then. My father used to send us a huge share of 7k from his 11k salary per month for the livings. 
I knew he tried every possible thing to provide for our needs. But still, we were finding it difficult to manage. We used to
take tiffins two times a day and the money crisis forced us to take it down to one time a day, and we started cooking on our 
own for the dinner which seemed less expensive. We mostly did not have the breakfast. Sometimes, Maggi used to be our only 
food. On the other hand, my parents were having a hard time. They managed to get their ration but were not able to save
anything for their medication, extra expenses and the school fees. Ultimately, my mother had to sell the few pieces of 
jewellery she had which managed our school fees.

Since my brother could not attend any coachings, he made me his doubt solver. He encouraged me and inspired me to study hard. 
He used to wash my clothes and the utensils so that I could get extra time for the study. So as time passed, it became more 
and more difficult for us to manage with the expenses. We experimented crazy methods like skipping the entire day meal and 
taking dinner only, renting a kitchen room for less money as a room and what not. 


It was the time for board examinations now. We had to clear all our dues in the school to get our admit cards. And in Nichlaul,
my father was diagnosed because of a stomach ache and as a result, stones were found in his Gall bladder. But my parents did 
not tell us a word about this. His condition was getting worse due to lack of proper medication. They decided to go to our 
village home for some reason. We are a combined family in the village. We have some decent amount of property there. My father
thought of borrowing some money giving some land on the lease. His condition got worsened even more when he got caught from 
Jaundice there. My grand-mother strictly denied for the land. My uncle told some of the people in the village to not to lend 
my father any money. He ultimately had to borrow money from a person on extremely high interest as he needed to submit our 
fees anyhow. 


We tried our best to prove the worth of our parent's struggle. We passed the boards with good percentage. I cleared the 
JEE with good rank. My brother found a good job. I recently graduated from IIT Kanpur and got a job at Oracle. I have always 
heard of parents being proud of their children. But today, at the end of this story, I feel proud of my parents üòçüòçüòç
