title : Reinforcement Learning &#58; Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO)
---

In this blog, we will be digging into another reinforcement learning algorithm, **Trust Region Policy Optimization** followed by **Proximal Policy Optimization**. Before discussing the algorithm directly, let us understand some of the concepts and reasonings for better explanations.

**ON & OFF Policies** : In the previous blog of the reinforcement learning thread, we studied about the A2C and A3C algorithms where we used to keep a replay buffer memory to store the previous states and randomly chose a batch to train the model. This type of strategy is said to be **OFF** as they do not update the model based on the current performance. The **ON** policy models, on the other hand, update the model episode by episode based on the current exploration of the agent.
