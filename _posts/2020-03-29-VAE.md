title: How to ___  Variational AutoEncoder ?
---

With the surfeit of blogs on this page, I decide to add one more to the list today. We will be talking about various terms like AutoEncoders and Variational AutoEncoders and finally implementing the latter one. So, you may have heard about data compression, right? It means nothing but encrypting the data in some form which consumes less memory and is capable to restore almost everything when required. Can we do it through machine learning? Obviously, we can and here comes the time when we discuss about autoencoders. So, let us kick in with the new blog.

#### What is an AutoEncoder?

So AutoEncoder is a type of neural network which is used to encode the data into a less-dimensional representation(in other words compress the data). It is an unsupervised algorithm in which we take the data, encode into a feature vector of lesser dimension and then try to regenerate the data from the compressed feature vector. So the encoding part of the network is called an Encoder, and the decoding part is called a Decoder which makes it an Encoder-Decoder architecture and since it regenerates the same input, it is named as AutoEncoder. Below is the diagram for an autoencoder.

The encoder and the decoder part can be anything like feedforward neural network, a convolutional network or a stack of LSTMs or GRUs based on our use case.
