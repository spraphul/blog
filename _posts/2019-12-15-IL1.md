title : Incremental Learning Without Forgetting
---

One of the major area of concern in deep learning is the generalisation problem. This has been a hot topic for research for the past few years. Generally what happens is that we get a use case, we build a model for that and we push it in production. But what if we have a slight change in our problem statement. Do we need to solve it once again from the scratch? What if we dont have the dataset we had previously? We seek for a way to preserve the previous learning of the system and work on just the evolution part. And we will be talking about one of the similar aspects of the problem in this blog. So, welcome to the new blog of **Learn & Share** thread and bear with me for some of the next few paragraphs.
