title : Unsupervised Image Segmentation
---

So, Just adding to the regular **"Learn and Share"** blog thread, we will go through the topic of Unsupervised Image 
Segmentation in this blog.

### What is segmentation?
So, what exactly is image segmentation? We will understand that through an image given below:

As, you can see from the picture, segmentation can be understood as grouping the pixels together which have similar attributes. The attributes can be colour, brightness, intensity etc. Thus, it can be seen that the pixels describing the cat have been given the same category, and so is for the pixels describing the grass, cow, trees respectively.


### How to do segmentation?
As study in machine learning has advanced this far, we have many methods for this problem. So, generally we have a 
dataset containing images and we also have the annotations of each image containing the label and boundary boxes for each 
object in the image file. Using the annotations, we can train the dataset on a deep learning network to learn to predict the 
segmentation of a newly given image.


### But, what if the annotations are not given?

This type of problems can be put in the category of unsupervised learning. So, we are going to discuss two methods to 
segment an image if we have an unsupervised dataset.


### Method 1 : (Based on Back-propagation)

Let me first show you the structure of the model and then we will go into the details:

![uis2](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VTs9pmoJdcE/XSYxM11DvNI/AAAAAAAAOIY/2XmXZrrFje0TZP3KSRQzn5F68orI_vPrACLcBGAs/s1600/1.png)

Given a RGB image, we can consider every pixel of the image as a 3x1 vector, i.e., the [R,G,B] values. So, each pixel of the 
image is passed through a convolutional neural network to obtain its high level feature vector. These feature vectors can be 
further used to do k-mean clustering with the help of which we assign labels to each pixel.

Let 'x' be the feature vector for a particular pixel in the image and 'f(x)' be a function which predicts the cluster 
label 'c' for the pixel. Now we have three things : 'x',' f(x)' and 'c' which need to be trained. This is done by alternately 
fixing the parameters for two things and training the third function at a time. For example, if 'c' is being predicted, we 
keep the parameters for 'x' and 'f(x)' constant. The weights or parameters are updated using back-propagation method using 
stochastic gradient optimiser.


For good segmentation, certain characteristics are required for the cluster label 'c'. Instance of any object contains 
patches of similar texture patterns. So, we should take this in account while performing segmentation. Hence, spatially 
continuous pixels that have similar colour and texture patterns should be grouped together. On the other hand, different 
object instances should be categorised separately. To facilitate this cluster separation, the number of cluster labels is 
desired to be large(>2).  


### Method 2 : (Domain Adaptation Based)

In this method, knowledge transfer or domain adaptation is done to close the gap of distributions of source and target domains. Based on the General Adversarial Network, this model consists of two parts:

Segmentation Network to predict the segmentation of the images, and the Discriminator network to tell whether the input image 
is from source domain or target domain. For example, I used the GTA game dataset as the source domain and the IIT Kanpur 
surveillance dataset as the target domain to train the model.

**The model architecture is given as follows:**

On the one hand the loss for the segmentation is minimised while simultaneously, the loss for the discriminator network is 
maximised so that it becomes difficult for the discriminator network to distinguish between the source and the target domains 
and thus the segmentation network can easily use the transferred knowledge from the GTA dataset(which is labelled) to predict
the segmentation for the IIT Kanpur dataset.
