title: Reinforcement Learning &#58; Q Learning made Simple

Recently, I started studying Reinforcement Learning and was fascinated by the potential it possesses. In this blog, we will have a quick discussion over the terms, Q-Learning and OpenAI gym library. Finally, we will be implementing a simple Q-Learning application on one of the gym environments.

Let us start with Q-Learning:

**Q-Learning** is an algorithm designed to find the best possible decision to take, given a current state. Let us imagine what a child will do if it is just kept at a random state and somewhere around it, lies a bar of chocolate. The child will try many times to stand, crawl, fail many times and ultimately will get the chocolate. This is similar to what a q-learning algorithm does. An agent is exposed to a surrounding completely unknown to it. It takes some random actions, gets the reward or punishment due to those actions and learns to take further decisions. 

You may be wondering if it does the same thing as supervised learning. The answer is NO. In reinforcement learning, **evaluative** learning happens whereas in supervised case, it is **instructive**. Meaning, in supervised learning, weights are updated using the pre-defined labels, so that the model does not predict the wrong class further. While in reinforcement learning, the agent tries every possible action and can keep predicting the wrong class if it is getting a higher reward for it and goes for the right class once it finds it.


Mathematically, it can be defined as follows:
