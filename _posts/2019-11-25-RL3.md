title: Reinforcement Learning &#58; Deep Q Networks
---

In the previous two blogs, I went through the basics of Q-learning, building a simple RL Agent using q-table and creating a custom 
environment for our own use case. But as we keep making the environment bigger and complex, the q-table becomes bigger in size 
and this causes a scaling problem. I studied about Deep Q-learning which solves this problem and I will be going through the topic in detail in this blog.
