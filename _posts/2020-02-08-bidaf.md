title : BiDirectional Attention Flow Model for Question Answering
---

Question Answering has been a major area of work in Natural Language Processing. I will be discussing as well as implementing the key elements of a research paper which does significantly well on QA related problems. So, What do we do in Question Answering? We are given a context and a query is asked based on that context. The task of the model is to find an accurate answer to the problem. The answer may or may not be present in the context itself. If it is present, the task can be formulated as a classification problem and if it is not present, then we move to a much tougher text-generation problem. But for all of that we need a fine feature vector which contains the information from context and query and their relationship.
