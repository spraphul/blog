In this blog, we will be visualising a Keras deep learning model in Tensorboard.

Tensorboard is a very nice platform provided by Google to visualise our machine learning models in the forms of graphs. We can visualise the model structure, metric graphs and many other things in a cool way here.

Since it is for TensorFlow graphs, I found it cool that it can also work for Keras models. But the Keras code should be written in TensorFlow backend.


**Let us quickly dive into the coding part:**

I will be writing a simple Keras model and show you how to visualise it in Tensorboard.


**We will do all the necessary imports first:**

<script src="https://gist.github.com/spraphul/a42f82acdb31883ea8ed758337590248.js"></script>

**Now we will create a simple text-classifier model:**

<script src="https://gist.github.com/spraphul/f3263a847f6a583af7a3fa282d05937c.js"></script>

**The graph is created when the model gets compiled. So just after creating the graph we will define our Tensorboard callback as follows:**

<script src="https://gist.github.com/spraphul/e5e23750ee0d83de0f3a6f4122521786.js"></script>

**Now we will train the model:**

We will switch to the terminal now and run the following command with the same log directory given in the code:

**$ tensorboard --logdir=your_log_dir**

Generally, the tensorboard starts on the **6006** port. Go to any browser in your system and type the port number followed by localhost or the public IP of the remote system you are working on. 

**Hurray!**  We are ready with our keras-tensorboard visualisation.

**Keep Learning, Keep Sharing ðŸ˜Š**
