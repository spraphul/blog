**Hi, Its Praphul here ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Š. <br/>**
I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur with a major in Electrical Engineering in 2019. I am currently working as a Deep Learning Engineer at Oracle, Bangalore. I have explored the fields of Machine Learning and Deep Learning with various projects covering the major portions of Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. This is a platform where I intend to share whatever I learn in the form of blogs. In case you feel like contacting me or just say a hello, I have a tons of links to share ðŸ˜€. You can find them in the **menu** section.

# Enjoy Reading!
