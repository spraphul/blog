I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur with a major in Electrical Engineering in 2019. I am currently working as a Deep Learning Engineer at Oracle, Bangalore. I have explored the fields of Machine Learning and Deep Learning with various projects covering the major portions of Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. This is a platform where I intend to share whatever I learn in the form of blogs.
